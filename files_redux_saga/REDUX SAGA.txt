Redux-thunk
Redux-thunk is the standard way of performing asynchronous operations in Redux.

For our purposes, a thunk represents a function that is not called immediately, only when needed. Take the example from redux-thunk’s documentation:


The value 3 is assigned immediately to x.

However, when we have something like the following statement:


The sum operation is not executed immediately, only when you call foo(). This makes foo a thunk.

Redux-thunk allows an action creator to dispatch a function in addition to a plain object, converting the action creator into a thunk.
